Follow below steps to complete this assignment,


Step 1 :  Create table executing below command,

                CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE DEMO_DB.PUBLIC.PART
                AS
                SELECT * FROM "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF1000"."PART";


Step 2 : 

              Create another table DEMO_DB.PUBLIC.PART_CLUSTERED  from DDL of above table created.

              you can get DDL by executing , select get_ddl('TABLE','DEMO_DB.PUBLIC.PART')

              Apply clustering by column, P_TYPE and P_SIZE.

 

Step 3 :

              Insert data into DEMO_DB.PUBLIC.PART_CLUSTERED after applying clustered key.

     

Step 4 : Compare query performance between clustered and  normal table.

                   1. SELECT * FROM DEMO_DB.PUBLIC.PART
                   WHERE P_TYPE ='LARGE BURNISHED BRASS' and p_size=50

               Mention how many micro partitions scanned ?

                   2. SELECT * FROM DEMO_DB.PUBLIC.PART_CLUSTERED
                       WHERE P_TYPE ='LARGE BURNISHED BRASS' and p_size=50

                    Mention how many micro partitions scanned ?
