STEP 1 :

            Download the file attached to the resource.

STEP 2 :

            Create table as


CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE TOBACCO

(

        Year       NUMBER ,

        Quarter NUMBER(1,0) ,

        LocationAbbr VARCHAR(2) ,

        LocationDesc VARCHAR(50) ,

        TopicDesc VARCHAR ,

        MeasureDesc VARCHAR(50) ,

        DataSource VARCHAR(3) ,

        ProvisionGroupDesc VARCHAR(50) ,

        ProvisionDesc VARCHAR(50) ,

        ProvisionValue VARCHAR ,

        Citation VARCHAR ,

        ProvisionAltValue NUMBER ,

        DataType VARCHAR ,

        Comments VARCHAR ,

        Enacted_Date DATE ,

        Effective_Date DATE ,

        GeoLocation ARRAY ,

        DisplayOrder NUMBER ,

        TopicTypeId VARCHAR(3) ,

        TopicId VARCHAR(100) ,

        MeasureId VARCHAR(20) ,

        ProvisionGroupID VARCHAR(10) ,

        ProvisionID NUMBER

);


STEP 3:

   Create a named stage by name, My_internal_stage.

   Create a file format by name My_csv_format.

STEP 4 :

    Login to snowsql and upload data from your local system to the named stage.

STEP 5 :

   1. Write SQL query to check uploaded data in the named stage(internal stage).  ( You should write it in web console.)

   2. Count the number of records in staging area. Without loading data to a snowflake.

STEP 6:

   > Write copy command to load data from named stage to table.

                 While Loading data using copy command please apply below transformation to `LocationAbbr` column.

                                                       if LocationAbbr='GU' then code it as GK.

                 This condition you should apply within copy command only.

  > You should not use any inline copy options in copy command like on_error, pattern etc... you should set these properties within stage object itself.

   > If you face any errors allow records to get rejected.

   > Collect all rejected records. How many rejected records are created and what is the rejection reason.

   > Create a separate table by name, TOBACCO_REJECTED to keep all rejected records.

STEP 7 :

   Mention all the reasons for records rejection.

STEP 8:

    remove the uploaded file in named staging area.
